We consider the problem of numerically computing the quantum dynamics of an
electron in twisted bilayer graphene. The challenge is that atomic-scale models of the dynamics are
aperiodic for generic twist angles because of the incommensurability of the layers. The BistritzerMacDonald PDE model, which is periodic with respect to the bilayer’s moir´e pattern, has recently
been shown to rigorously describe these dynamics in a parameter regime. In this work, we first prove
that the dynamics of the tight-binding model of incommensurate twisted bilayer graphene can be
approximated by computations on finite domains. The main ingredient of this proof is a speed of
propagation estimate proved using Combes-Thomas estimates. We then provide extensive numerical
computations which clarify the range of validity of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model.
