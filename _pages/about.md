I am a 2nd year applied mathematics Ph.D. student at the University of Minnesota. My advisor is Prof.[Mitchell Luskin](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~luskin/). I earned an Honors B.S. in applied mathematics and B.A. in physics at University of Chicago in 2021. My research interests are math modeling, numerical analysis, optimization and machine learning.

Currently my research focuses on developing mathematical formulations and analysis to model and compute properties of 2D Moire materials, especially finding rigorous numerical methods to study time evolution of wavepackets in these materials.

I also enjoy photography, movies, cycling, soccer...
